# Shan Bhoharia's Study Hub - Deployment Guide

## 📋 Overview
This is a complete deployment guide for your study hub website. The application is read-only for students - only you (admin) can add content through the admin panel.

## 🚀 Free Hosting Options (Recommended: Vercel)

### Option 1: Vercel (Best for Full-Stack Apps) - FREE
1. **Create GitHub Account**: Go to github.com and create an account
2. **Upload Code**: 
   - Create new repository called "shan-study-hub"
   - Upload all project files (drag & drop the ZIP contents)
3. **Deploy on Vercel**:
   - Go to vercel.com and sign up with GitHub
   - Click "Import Project" → Select your repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect it's a Node.js app
   - Click "Deploy" - Done!

### Option 2: Railway (Good Alternative) - FREE
1. Go to railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. "Deploy from GitHub" → Select your repository
4. Railway auto-deploys your app

### Option 3: Render (Also Good) - FREE
1. Go to render.com 
2. Create account and connect GitHub
3. "New Web Service" → Select repository
4. Use these settings:
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`

## 🗄️ Database Setup (Required for all options)

### Free PostgreSQL Database - Neon
1. **Create Database**:
   - Go to neon.tech
   - Sign up for free account
   - Create new project: "shan-study-hub"
   - Copy the connection string (DATABASE_URL)

2. **Add Environment Variables**:
   - In your hosting platform (Vercel/Railway/Render)
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add: `DATABASE_URL` = your neon database connection string

3. **Initialize Database**:
   - After deployment, run: `npm run db:push` 
   - This creates all the tables automatically
